## Overview

Withings-SDK-iOS provides an Objective-C interface for integrating iOS apps with the [Withings API](http://oauth.withings.com/api). It handles OAuth 1.0 authentication using [OAuthSwift library](https://github.com/OAuthSwift/OAuthSwift).


## Requirements

Withings-SDK-iOS requires iOS 8.0 and above.


In order to use the API, you will need to register as a developer [here](https://oauth.withings.com/partner/add) to get a consumer key and secret. Note that you will also need to have an end-user Withings account to fetch data from. 


Several third-party open source libraries are used within Withings-SDK-iOS:

1. [OAuthSwift](https://github.com/OAuthSwift/OAuthSwift) - OAuth support
2. [DCKeyValueObjectMapping](https://github.com/dchohfi/KeyValueObjectMapping) - JSON mapping
3. [SSKeychain](https://github.com/soffes/SSKeychain) - Keychain wrapper
